# Hand Cricket in Python
This project aims to re-create the handcricket game in python.
NumPy `random` was used to generate random numbers.

## Rules of this game.
The game consits of two rounds namely batting and bowling. The game starts with a toss between you and the robot. If you win the toss, you get to choose between batting and bowling else the robot will randomely choose.
If you bat,then you have to put input numbers from 1 - 10 the robot will randomely choose a number.
If you and the robot chooses the same number, then you lose and the robot will bat next.
The robot will bat and try to exceed your score if it achieves that then you lose.
The aim of the game is to beat the score of the robot.
While bowling, you should try to get the same number as that of bot inorder to make him lose the round.

Enjoy the game! [file link](https://github.com/ShivaNach/Hand-Cricket-in-Python/blob/main/handcricket-game-in-python.py)
