# Hand Cricket in Python
This project aims to re-create the famous game of handcricket in python.
NumPy `random` was used to generate random numbers.

## Rules of this game.
The game consits of two rounds namely batting and bowling. The game starts with a toss between the player and the bot. If the player wins the toss, then they get to choose between batting and bowling else the robot will randomely choose.
If the player bats,then they have to put input numbers from 1 - 10 the bot will randomly choose a number.
If the player and the bot chooses the same number, then they lose and the bot will bat next.
The bot will bat and try to exceed the player's score, if it achieves in doing so, then you lose.
The aim of the game is to beat the score of the bot.
While bowling, the player should try to get the same number as that of bot inorder to make the bot lose the round.
